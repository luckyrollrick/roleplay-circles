            <p>Roleplay Circles ("we," "us," or "our") is a sales roleplay matching platform that helps sales teams practice and improve. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time use only</strong> — we do not store the content of your calendar events long-term. Calendar data is fetched in real time when needed and used only to display availability and detect no-shows.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Within your circles</strong> — your name, avatar, and availability are visible to other members of circles you've joined</li>
                <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — we may use hosting and infrastructure providers who process data on our behalf under strict confidentiality</li>
                <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> — if required by law or to protect the safety of our users</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
