            <p>Roleplay Circles ("we," "us," or "our") is a sales roleplay matching platform that helps sales teams practice and improve. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account information</strong> — your display name, email address, and a securely hashed password</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar data</strong> — if you provide an ICS calendar URL, we fetch events in real time to determine when you're free for roleplay sessions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage data</strong> — roleplay session history, circle memberships, and activity within the platform</li>
                <li><strong>Device information</strong> — basic browser and device info for functionality and troubleshooting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authenticate your identity and manage your account</li>
                <li>Display your availability to other members in your circles</li>
                <li>Match you with roleplay partners based on availability</li>
                <li>Show calendar events so you and your team know when someone's free or busy</li>
                <li>Track roleplay sessions, streaks, and leaderboard stats</li>
                <li>Improve the platform and fix issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Calendar Data</h2>
            <p>We take your calendar data seriously:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time use only</strong> — we do not store the content of your calendar events long-term. Calendar data is fetched in real time when needed and used only to display availability and detect no-shows.</li>
                <li><strong>No sharing</strong> — we do not share your calendar data with third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.</li>
                <li><strong>Your control</strong> — you can remove your calendar ICS URL at any time from Settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data.</strong> Period.</p>
            <p>We may share limited information only in these cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Within your circles</strong> — your display name and availability are visible to other members of circles you've joined</li>
                <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — we may use hosting and infrastructure providers who process data on our behalf under strict confidentiality</li>
                <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> — if required by law or to protect the safety of our users</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
            <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. You can request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time. When you delete your account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your profile information is permanently removed</li>
                <li>Your session history and circle memberships are deleted</li>
                <li>Your password hash is permanently deleted</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Security</h2>
            <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS), secure password hashing, and access controls. No system is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to keep your information safe.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
